What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates the .git directory to track the changes that happens to the files inside it.
Without files in .git directory, git application can not obtain the history of files in
the repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value
 do you think it offers?

Staging area is not equivalent to a real directory on the computer. It allows us to control
the files that are going to be committed, and those which aren't, before making the actual 
commit to the repository.
